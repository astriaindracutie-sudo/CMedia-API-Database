### Must-Have Frontend Features:

### Cool Optional Frontend Features:

1.  **Interactive Service Configurator:**
    *   A tool where users can build their own custom bundles (e.g., choosing internet speed, adding IPTV channels, selecting hosting features) and see the price dynamically update.
2.  **Availability Checker:**

7.  **Responsive Design & Mobile-First Approach:**
    *   Ensure the website looks and functions perfectly on all devices. (This is almost a must-have in today's world, but listing it here as a "cool optional" if we're focusing purely on core functionality first).
8.  **SEO Optimization:**
    *   Proper meta tags, sitemaps, and content structure for better search engine visibility.
9.  **Animated Backgrounds/Visuals:**
    *   Building on `Starfield.tsx` from `cmedia-api/frontend/src/components/`, we could use dynamic, subtle animations to enhance the user experience and reflect the "high-speed" or "connectivity" aspects.
10. **Multi-language Support:**
    *   If the company targets a diverse audience.

I've created a TODO list based on the must-have features. I will mark them as in-progress as we work on them.

Which of these must-have features would you like to start with first? Given `project-map-1`'s existing structure, perhaps we could begin by integrating the authentication with the backend or enhancing the `CustomerDashboard.jsx`.
